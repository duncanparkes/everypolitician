We’re building a publicly available, open list of all the world’s politicians, in a standardised format. 

## Why? 

Because, if data is in a standard structured format, it can be reused by
developers everywhere. They don’t have waste time scraping data and
converting it into a format they can use; instead, they can simply
concentrate on making useful tools. 

And those tools can more easily be picked up, used and adapted to local
needs anywhere in the world, saving everyone time and effort.

The format is [Popolo](http://www.popoloproject.com/), the new data
standard for politicians’ details.

## How do I get involved?

If you already have Popolo format data for your country’s politicians,
let us know, and we’ll add it to the growing list.

If you have the information in another format, and would like assistance
converting it to Popolo, talk to us, and we’ll see if we can help. We’re
building tools to make that process easier, and we’d love to test them
out on your data.

## Which politicians do you care about?

Initially we’re only collecting information about 
[country-level Parliaments and Congresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legislatures_by_country).
Eventually we hope that much more than this will be available, but we
think that getting every national legislature would be a great first
step.

## What information about them do you want?

Popolo lets you express lots of complex information about your
politicians and their history. If you have the time and skills to put
lots of that together, then great! The UK data, for example, lists 
[every Member of Parliament for the last 100 years](https://parliament.popit.mysociety.org/persons/). 

But for now all we’re focussed on simply getting basic information about
the current legislators in every country. Even just their names,
political parties, and areas represented is enough. Part of the beauty
of Popolo is that it’s easy to add more complex data at any stage, and
we’ll be encouraging people to do just that later.

## What next?

Each jurisdiction’s data will be used to populate a PopIt site, like
[this](https://sinar-malaysia.popit.mysociety.org/). These can be used
as standalone resources to publish politicians’ details, but they can
also be used in bigger projects, such as making it easy to [track what
those politicians say](http://sayit.poplus.org/), or for citizens to
[send public messages to them](http://writeit.poplus.org/). 

As more and more countries produce data in the same format, more and
more similar tools will also become possible.
